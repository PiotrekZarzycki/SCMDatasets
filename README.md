Surface Complexation Modeling Synthetic Datasets

These is repository containing synthetic datasets for various types of Surface Complexation Models, with varying coverage of the parameter space.

Datasets: 
TLM_2pK_OXIDES_set_001.txt  
This datset was created using 2-pK TLM model as defined by D. Sverjensky (ref. ), exploring the parameter space consitently with the range of values reported in this paper.
